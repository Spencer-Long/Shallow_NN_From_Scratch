# Building A Shallow Neural Network From Scratch

---

#### **Project Description:**

I recently was tasked with leading the SNR Analytics team to build a Shallow Neural Network(SNN) to help predict if a patient should receive Immunotherapy treatment using a 3 gene signature we discovered using the JAMMIT Algorithm. I know we can easily implement a SNN using Tensor Flow or other various libraries quickly and efficiently. Yet, to make sure I had a good understanding of how a shallow NN functions and to fully grasp the mathematics behind one I dove deep by building a SNN from scratch using Python.
